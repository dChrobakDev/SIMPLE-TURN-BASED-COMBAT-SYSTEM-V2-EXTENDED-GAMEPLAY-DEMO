# SIMPLE TURN-BASED COMBAT SYSTEM V2 | EXTENDED GAMEPLAY DEMO

## üìã Description

This is an extended version of my educational mini-project:  
A simple turn-based combat simulator written in C++.

The player can:
- Perform normal attacks (with a 20% chance for critical hits)
- Use a DMG buff (+15% attack bonus for the next round, 5-round cooldown)
- Use a Defense buff (-15% enemy attack reduction for the next round, 4-round cooldown)
- Heal (+20 HP, 6-round cooldown)
- Dodge (avoid all incoming damage, 3-round cooldown)
- Skip rounds to observe enemy attacks.

The system includes cooldown mechanics, random damage generation, conditional logic for buffs, critical hits, and combat resolution.

This project demonstrates:
- Random number generation (`rand`, `srand`)
- `switch-case` control flow
- Loops and conditionals
- Basic combat logic and game design patterns
